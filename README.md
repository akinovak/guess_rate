# guess_rate

I used hotel reviews dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/hotel-reviews

Idea of this project is to guess is comment postive or negative and with given comments to predict what is rate of hotel.

Data set has about 500k reviews.

Classification is done by method of SVM and KNN with PCA dimensional reduction.

For comment prediction I used various tools and alogirthms line natural language processing kit, naive bias and inverse document transformation
